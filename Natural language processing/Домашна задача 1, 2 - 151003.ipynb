    "then common. Increasingly, however, research has focused on statistical models, which make soft, probabilistic \n",
    "decisions based on attaching real-valued weights to each input feature. Such models have the advantage that they can \n",

    "on hand-crafted rules, beyond which the systems become more and more unmanageable. However, creating more data to \n",
    "input to machine-learning systems simply requires a corresponding increase in the number of man-hours worked, \n",

    "Major tasks[edit] The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in NLP. Note that some of \n",
    "these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in \n",
    "solving larger tasks. What distinguishes these tasks from other potential and actual NLP tasks is not only the volume \n",
    "of research devoted to them but the fact that for each one there is typically a well-defined problem setting, \n",
    "a standard metric for evaluating the task, standard corpora on which the task can be evaluated, and competitions \n",
    "devoted to the specific task. \n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic summarization Produce a readable summary of a chunk of text. Often used to provide summaries of text of a \n",
    "known type, such as articles in the financial section of a newspaper. Coreference resolution Given a sentence or \n",
    "larger chunk of text, determine which words (\"mentions\") refer to the same objects (\"entities\"). Anaphora resolution \n",
    "is a specific example of this task, and is specifically concerned with matching up pronouns with the nouns or names \n",
    "that they refer to. The more general task of coreference resolution also includes identifying so-called \"bridging \n",
    "relationships\" involving referring expressions. For example, in a sentence such as \"He entered John's house through \n",
    "the front door\", \"the front door\" is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified is the \n",
    "fact that the door being referred to is the front door of John's house (rather than of some other structure that \n",
    "might also be referred to). Discourse analysis This rubric includes a number of related tasks. One task is \n",
    "identifying the discourse structure of connected text, i.e. the nature of the discourse relationships between \n",
    "sentences (e.g. elaboration, explanation, contrast). Another possible task is recognizing and classifying the speech \n",
    "acts in a chunk of text (e.g. yes-no question, content question, statement, assertion, etc.). Machine translation \n",
    "Automatically translate text from one human language to another. This is one of the most difficult problems, \n",
    "and is a member of a class of problems colloquially termed \"AI-complete\", i.e. requiring all of the different types \n",
    "of knowledge that humans possess (grammar, semantics, facts about the real world, etc.) in order to solve properly. \n",
    "Morphological segmentation Separate words into individual morphemes and identify the class of the morphemes. The \n",
    "difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the morphology (i.e. the structure of words) of the \n",
    "language being considered. English has fairly simple morphology, especially inflectional morphology, and thus it is \n",
    "often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word (e.g. \"open, opens, opened, \n",
    "opening\") as separate words. In languages such as Turkish or Manipuri,[6] a highly agglutinated Indian language, \n",
    "however, such an approach is not possible, as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms. Named \n",
    "entity recognition (NER) Given a stream of text, determine which items in the text map to proper names, \n",
    "such as people or places, and what the type of each such name is (e.g. person, location, organization). Note that, \n",
    "although capitalization can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as English, this information cannot \n",
    "aid in determining the type of named entity, and in any case is often inaccurate or insufficient. For example, \n",
    "the first word of a sentence is also capitalized, and named entities often span several words, only some of which are \n",
    "capitalized. Furthermore, many other languages in non-Western scripts (e.g. Chinese or Arabic) do not have any \n",
    "capitalization at all, and even languages with capitalization may not consistently use it to distinguish names. For \n",
    "example, German capitalizes all nouns, regardless of whether they refer to names, and French and Spanish do not \n",
    "capitalize names that serve as adjectives. Natural language generation Convert information from computer databases or \n",
    "semantic intents into readable human language. Natural language understanding Convert chunks of text into more formal \n",
    "representations such as first-order logic structures that are easier for computer programs to manipulate. Natural \n",
    "language understanding involves the identification of the intended semantic from the multiple possible semantics \n",
    "which can be derived from a natural language expression which usually takes the form of organized notations of \n",
    "natural languages concepts. Introduction and creation of language metamodel and ontology are efficient however \n",
    "empirical solutions. An explicit formalization of natural languages semantics without confusions with implicit \n",
    "assumptions such as closed-world assumption (CWA) vs. open-world assumption, or subjective Yes/No vs. objective \n",
    "True/False is expected for the construction of a basis of semantics formalization.[7] Optical character recognition (\n",
    "OCR) Given an image representing printed text, determine the corresponding text. Part-of-speech tagging Given a \n",
    "sentence, determine the part of speech for each word. Many words, especially common ones, can serve as multiple parts \n",
    "of speech. For example, \"book\" can be a noun (\"the book on the table\") or verb (\"to book a flight\"); \"set\" can be a \n",
    "noun, verb or adjective; and \"out\" can be any of at least five different parts of speech. Some languages have more \n",
    "such ambiguity than others. Languages with little inflectional morphology, such as English are particularly prone to \n",
    "such ambiguity. Chinese is prone to such ambiguity because it is a tonal language during verbalization. Such \n",
    "inflection is not readily conveyed via the entities employed within the orthography to convey intended meaning. \n",
    "Parsing Determine the parse tree (grammatical analysis) of a given sentence. The grammar for natural languages is \n",
    "ambiguous and typical sentences have multiple possible analyses. In fact, perhaps surprisingly, for a typical \n",
    "sentence there may be thousands of potential parses (most of which will seem completely nonsensical to a human). \n",
    "Question answering Given a human-language question, determine its answer. Typical questions have a specific right \n",
    "answer (such as \"What is the capital of Canada?\"), but sometimes open-ended questions are also considered (such as \n",
    "\"What is the meaning of life?\"). Recent works have looked at even more complex questions.[8] Relationship extraction \n",

    "breaking (also known as sentence boundary disambiguation) Given a chunk of text, find the sentence boundaries. \n",
    "Sentence boundaries are often marked by periods or other punctuation marks, but these same characters can serve other \n",
    "purposes (e.g. marking abbreviations). Sentiment analysis Extract subjective information usually from a set of \n",
    "documents, often using online reviews to determine \"polarity\" about specific objects. It is especially useful for \n",

    "sound clip of a person or people speaking, determine the textual representation of the speech. This is the opposite \n",
    "of text to speech and is one of the extremely difficult problems colloquially termed \"AI-complete\" (see above). In \n",

    "Word sense disambiguation Many words have more than one meaning; we have to select the meaning which makes the most \n",
    "sense in context. For this problem, we are typically given a list of words and associated word senses, e.g. from a \n",
    "dictionary or from an online resource such as WordNet. In some cases, sets of related tasks are grouped into \n",
    "subfields of NLP that are often considered separately from NLP as a whole. Examples include: \n",

    "Information retrieval (IR) This is concerned with storing, searching and retrieving information. It is a separate \n",
    "field within computer science (closer to databases), but IR relies on some NLP methods (for example, stemming). Some \n",

    "Evaluation[edit] Objectives[edit] The goal of NLP evaluation is to measure one or more qualities of an algorithm or a \n",
    "system, in order to determine: whether the algorithm answers the goals of its designers, or if the system meets the \n",
    "needs of its users. Research in NLP evaluation has received considerable attention, because the definition of proper \n",

    "1987, the first evaluation campaign on written texts seems to be a campaign dedicated to message understanding (\n",
    "Pallet 1998). The Parseval/GEIG project compared phrase-structure grammars (Black 1991). There were series of \n",

    "procedures, a number of distinctions are traditionally made in NLP evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Intrinsic v. extrinsic evaluation Intrinsic evaluation considers an isolated NLP system and characterizes its \n",
    "performance with respect to a gold standard result as defined by the evaluators. Extrinsic evaluation, also called \n",
    "evaluation in use, considers the NLP system in a more complex setting as either an embedded system or a precise \n",
    "function for a human user. The extrinsic performance of the system is then characterized in terms of utility with \n",
    "respect to the overall task of the extraneous system or the human user. For example, consider a syntactic parser \n",
    "which is based on the output of some part of speech (POS) tagger. An intrinsic evaluation would run the POS tagger on \n",
    "structured data, and compare the system output of the POS tagger to the gold standard output. An extrinsic evaluation \n",
    "would run the parser with some other POS tagger, and then with the novel POS tagger, and compare the parsing \n",
    "accuracy. Black-box v. glass-box evaluation Black-box evaluation requires someone to run an NLP system on a sample \n",
    "data set and to measure a number of parameters related to: the quality of the process, such as speed, reliability, \n",
    "resource consumption; and most importantly, the quality of the result, such as the accuracy of data annotation or the \n",
    "fidelity of a translation. Glass-box evaluation looks at the: design of the system; the algorithms that are \n",
    "implemented; the linguistic resources it uses, like vocabulary size or expression set cardinality. Given the \n",
    "complexity of NLP problems, it is often difficult to predict performance only on the basis of glass-box evaluation; \n",
    "but this type of evaluation is more informative with respect to error analysis or future developments of a system. \n",
    "Automatic v. manual evaluation In many cases, automatic procedures can be defined to evaluate an NLP system by \n",
    "comparing its output with the gold standard one. Although the cost of reproducing the gold standard can be quite \n",
    "high, bootstrapping automatic evaluation on the same input data can be repeated as often as needed without inordinate \n",
    "additional costs. However, for many NLP problems the precise definition of a gold standard is a complex task and it \n",
    "can prove impossible when inter-annotator agreement is insufficient. Manual evaluation is best performed by human \n",
    "judges instructed to estimate the quality of a system, or most often of a sample of its output, based on a number of \n",
    "criteria. Although, thanks to their linguistic competence, human judges can be considered as the reference for a \n",
    "number of language processing tasks, there is also considerable variation across their ratings. That is why automatic \n",
